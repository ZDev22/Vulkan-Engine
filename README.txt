A sprite-based C++ Vulkan engine.

As this is developed for WINDOWS and LINUX, to run this program, take it into VSCode or VSCodium and deleted the contents of the build folder. Then run the command "cd build" in the terminal, then run "cmake .." and after that, if you are on windows run "ninja" and if your are on Linux run "make -j8". These commands require downloads not included with this project.

Currently dosen't work out-of-the-box for some users as it requires some C++ dependencies installed on your computer.
Exact setup is unknown as I have not done much testing, but if you have a C++ coding background, it might work.



Still in development! Shared so you guys can look at my code!
